% CreateSRandomInterleaver produces a S-random interleaver.
% Warning: It can take a significant time to run.
%
% The calling syntax is:
%     [alpha] = CreateSRandomInterleaver( K, S )
%
%     alpha  = the interleaver in a length K vector 
%
%     K      = the size of the interleaver
%     S      = S value (determines amount of spread)
%     Note: the value of S greatly influences run time.
